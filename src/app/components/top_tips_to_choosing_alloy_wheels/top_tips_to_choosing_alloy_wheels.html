              Since coming into the main market in the 1960’s, alloy wheels have become an increasingly popular choice among auto enthusiasts. Their composition of aluminium and magnesium makes them strong, durable and helps to improve heat conduction. To top it off, they also look better than their traditional counterparts!
              We know there are many different options available when choosing alloy wheels, so we’ve put together our top tips to make your search easier!            </p>
        <h6 class="white saira" style="font-size: 25px">Consider the size of the wheels</h6>
            <p style="font-size: 15px">
              Many vehicle owners choose a bigger size of alloy wheel - different from the original size of their vehicle. Get it wrong and it can be a costly affair! Be sure to double check if using the wrong size has a negative impact on your manufacturer’s warranty and speak with an expert to be sure there are no safety concerns. Take your time in finding the right size wheel for your vehicle and go through all the checks and advisories.              </p>
        <h6 class="white saira" style="font-size: 25px"> Check the rim diameter</h6>
            <p style="font-size: 15px">
              More often than not the size of the wheel is determined by the rim diameter. If it’s possible to do so, you’re best to stick with the original width of the rim but if you have chosen to buy a wider rim, you may also have to pay for wheel replacement. Also, remember that if incorrect you can get issues with other things such as your steering rod or suspension components. If you’re unsure, speak with a mechanic or expert.
              Once you’ve chosen your alloy wheels there are more decisions to be made. You can have the colour of your wheels changed or further down the line take a look into services like Diamond cut alloy wheel refurbishment. </p><p>This is where we recut the face of your diamond cut alloy wheel to remove damage and corrosion.
