        In our previous blog posts, we gave the low down on how to accurately measure your wheel and tire size to find the best fit for your vehicle. Now we’re going to take a look at the cosmetics and how you should match your driving goals with style preferences.      </p>

        Want to just personalise your vehicle and make it stand out from the crowd? If you’re after upgraded aesthetics but aren’t concerned about changing your current ride performance, things are easy. You can keep the same sizing but just swap out your wheels for something showier.      </p>
 
  <h6 class="white saira" style="font-size: 25px"> For better acceleration and cornering  </h6>
      <p style="font-size: 15px">
        If you’re looking for performance enhancements such as better acceleration and cornering, aftermarket wheels may be something worth looking into. Choosing a larger diameter wheel will decrease the tires sidewall height and this will add responsiveness, meaning you’ll notice better cornering and generally higher stability. When done correctly, larger wheels can help to improve acceleration and reduce braking distance. We advise you speak with an expert regarding choosing larger wheels for your vehicle.
        Be aware that bigger diameter wheels can mean shorter tire life and be a more costly option than conventional sizes. You may also notice you feel bumps in the road a little more than normal.    
        Something else you may wish to consider if you own a truck or large pickup vehicle is weight. Take into consideration how much maximum weight you’ll generally carry in your vehicle and seek advice based around this. A heavier set up could mean a longer stopping distance with increased suspensions and increased brake wear.      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 15px">
        Smaller wheels are mounted with tires that have a higher aspect ratio (see our previous post for more about this) resulting in a more comfortable ride with less road feedback. Taller sidewall tires generally mean you’ll feel more flex when you turn corners and you may also notice a difference in handling.
        Fitting into smaller wheels isn’t possible for every vehicle due to fitment. Speak to a specialist and if you do have some room to go smaller with your wheels, you’ll have loads of tire tread design possibilities.
        Keep in mind that no matter what wheels you choose, some wheel finishes require more maintenance than others particularly where winter de-icing chemicals on the road play a part. Ask questions when you buy to ensure you’re armed with all the relevant information you need to take care of your wheels.
